Procedurally generated space backgrounds

This software is part of a game I'm programming at the moment. 
I made the generator for the Monthly Challenge January 2017 of r/proceduralgeneration. You can find my comment here:

This branch is the original version as used in the contest. It will not be updated and is here only for historical purpose.
This software can be used with the same terms as the master branch, but I won't update this branch.
